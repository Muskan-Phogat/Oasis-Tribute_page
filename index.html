        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Nikola Tesla was a Serbian‑American inventor, electrical engineer,
          mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to
          the design of the modern alternating‑current (AC) electricity supply
          system. His pioneering work laid the foundation for wireless
          communication, X‑ray imaging, and radio‑frequency control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout his life Tesla filed more than 300 patents and envisioned
          technologies—from wireless power transmission to autonomous
          drones—that were decades ahead of their time. Though often
          overshadowed in his era, he remains a symbol of visionary genius and
          relentless curiosity.
